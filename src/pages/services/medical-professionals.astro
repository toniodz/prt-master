            I have been both surprised and relieved to find, towards the end of my career, an approach to treating people in both acute and chronic pain that does work with many of the people I would previously have felt like I couldn't really help. If this is the first time you are reading about pain or emotion reprocessing, then I encourage you to look at some of the research references I have listed below.</p>
            
           <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
           I work with many different health professionals: physiotherapists, psychologists, pain consultants, orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists. etc. I can complement what you are doing or have already done and help you get your patients all the way to a full recovery.</p>

The results also showed a majority maintained that improvement a year after treatment which consisted of 8 sessions over one month.</p>

              "I was referred to Caroline at a time when I was experiencing severe and unmanageable pain flare, with no obvious provoking factor, following an already extensive period of persistent radiating pain. This had failed to respond to a traditional programme of rehabilitation or an escalation in medication. When the concept of pain reprocessing was first explained, I was sceptical whilst trying to sound open minded at the same time 🙂. But the way in which Caroline explained the process as we've worked through it, supported me therapeutically through the challenges and coached me to adopt a different approach, has been transformational. It has given me new tools in my self- management toolkit, for which I am very grateful."
