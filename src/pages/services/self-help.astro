            I work with quite a few people who have done really good work in finding, researching and trying pain reprocessing for themselves. But, for many reasons, that aren't always obvious until we dig into it, it hasn't yet worked for them yet.

            Although pain reprocessing can seem superficially easy to follow from steps in a book or podcast, it can take some finessing it to do it successfully, and this can be hard to do on your own. Here are some of the potential problems that you might run into:

            Getting help with this is not a sign of failure, I really admire people who have tried this themselves, the work you will have already done will help us immensely when we start working together.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            I will make sure you are doing the pain reprocessing correctly, review your journey to identify what might be missing, and then address any underlying factors that may not have been fully explored.
