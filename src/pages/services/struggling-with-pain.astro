              Whether you are struggling with pain from a recent injury, you just woke up in pain one day, you have had pain for months or even years; it is really difficult to imagine it ever going away— especially when nothing you have tried has helped so far.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              It can feel very lonely being in pain, very few people understand what it is like. And, it's overwhelming to have to do all your own research on how to get better when you are already struggling with everything else in your life.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              This is how I can help you— I have thoroughly researched in this approach and wouldn't be using it if it didn't have both scientific merit and clinical success. I am seeing people with both short-term pain get better much more quickly than before and I am seeing people with longer term pain finally see improvements in their pain and lives.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why will this work when Traditional Treatments haven't?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Most traditional treatments focus solely on the physical aspects of pain, but pain is not what we think it is.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              We now understand that pain is actually created in our brains from information it gets from our bodies, and what is going on in our lives. Pain is actually our brain's way of getting our attention to any threats to our ability to thrive and survive— including problems at work, home, or in our relationships—we can even be a threat to ourselves, subconsciously triggering our own pain, if we push ourselves a lot.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Our brains are also very protective of us and can also get into the habit of switching the pain on every day, even after the original issue has healed or the problem has been solved. So, a traditional treatment might help for a short time but the brain then returns to its old habits.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              It's a bit like trying to change something at work by just talking to your colleagues; unless you also talk to your boss(es) you are unlikely to get any lasting change. Pain Reprocessing Therapy goes straight to your boss!
