          Although I specialize in treating people with chronic pain, pain reprocessing is also highly effective for treating regular aches and pains. Pain reprocessing is included in any regular physiotherapy I do and regular physiotherapy is also included in your pain reprocessing- when helpful.

            People I see with short-term pain are getting better more quickly with these therapies and are avoiding the pain becoming chronic. Regular aches, pains and sprains--including those from arthritis-- can all be helped by pain reprocessing.

              "I went to see Caroline when I had a very painful shoulder. Another physiotherapist had mentioned the possibility of injections, and I wanted to explore other options. Caroline gave me some great exercises to do but also talked to me about what was going on in my life and why my body may be reacting to my stress by giving me pain; as a kind of cry for help. I found Caroline's way of explaining pain incredibly new and thought provoking. I was not the best patient in terms of keeping to my exercise routine, but by changing the narrative surrounding the acute pain in my shoulder and by addressing the other things going on in my life, it has got better."
