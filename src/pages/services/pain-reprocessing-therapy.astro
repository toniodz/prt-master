            Pain Reprocessing Therapy is an innovative approach that combines new knowledge in pain and neuroscience with practical techniques, to reduce your pain. It came into the headlines in 2022 when a research trial showed some impressive reductions in pain for people with many years of back pain.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            As it turns out, our brains have the ultimate authority over our pain— whether to start it—stop it—increase it—lower it— or put it to the back of our minds. Yes, our brains decide what pain is helpful to our cause, based on everything that is going on in our bodies, everything that has happened in our past, everything that it expects could happen in our future and anything and everything that might threaten our lives, or even just our way of life! Pain is complex and individual but understanding it properly gives us the leverage to change it, and that is what this therapy is all about.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Pain Reprocessing Therapy literally reprograms our brains to lower the pain.
