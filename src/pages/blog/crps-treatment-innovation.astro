    If you close your eyes, can you picture where your legs are or what position they are in? Can you feel what direction your knees are pointing to or how bent your ankles are? Can you feel your feet on the floor or the hardness or softness of it? Can you feel the softness of your socks or the pressure of your shoes around your feet?

    These are the types of questions I might ask someone with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) while doing a session of Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation (CMR) or "Safe Sensations", as one of my patients aptly named it. I first came across this approach when I worked at a NHS national specialist service for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) at the Royal United Hospital Foundation Trust, in Bath which runs a two-week residential programme. The goal of this innovative therapy is to help people with CRPS rediscover their normal arm or leg sensations or feelings which can restart the process of recovering from this condition.
