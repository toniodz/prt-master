              Hi, I'm Caroline Davies, a physiotherapist specialising in Pain Reprocessing Therapy. I combine medical expertise and a compassionate approach to help you break free from pain. Over my 27-year career I have worked with people with every kind of acute, chronic, and complex pain in the UK and US. However, it hasn't been until the last few years that I feel like I have really got something to offer people in pain: the chance to finally get better.

              Three new treatment approaches have completely changed my expectations for recovery from pain, including people who have been in pain for years or who have the most severe pain conditions...
